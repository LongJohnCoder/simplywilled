        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Keep It Simple, LLC (“Keep It Simple, “Us,” “We”) is sensitive to your concerns regarding how we use the personal information we collect from our websites and other plug-ins that exchange information with us.  (The Site and Applications are sometimes collectively referred to as "Online Services" for simplicity).  We take your privacy seriously, and have implemented this privacy policy to ensure your personal and financial information is handled in a secure manner.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">In the course of utilizing our Online Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information, such as information that can be used to contact or identify you, information that you input on our site, and information regarding your use of, and activities at, our web site (“Personal Information”). This privacy policy applies to all of the products, services and web sites offered by Keep It Simple, LLC and informs you of how we collect, use, disclose and protect your Personal Information.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our <a _ngcontent-c1="" routerlink="/terms-of-use" href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and <a _ngcontent-c1="" routerlink="/terms-of-service" href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, and therefore governs your use of the Online Services. By using Keep It Simple Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>



        <span _ngcontent-c1="" class="terms_heading">Changes to our Privacy Policy</span>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the “Last Updated” date above. </p>



        <span _ngcontent-c1="" class="terms_heading">Information We Collect</span>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Personal Information that you provide via our websites, plug-ins, forms, and documents may be automatically collected by Keep It Simple.  Keep It Simple requires each customer to provide us with Personal Information to access and use the Online Services. Personal Information is captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a Keep It Simple employee or agent, and willingly discloses that information.  It may be collected when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by Keep It Simple, its subsidiaries and affiliates.  Our secure servers also automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a web site.</p>



        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Personally Identifiable Information includes but is not limited to: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) "Financial Data" (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code or bank account information); (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your zip code and sex); and (iv) other "Legal Data" (such as your social security number, mortgage information, automobile information, marital information, trade secrets, inventions, and idea submissions and other sensitive information necessary to generate legal documents).</p>



        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We may also collect the information of third party individuals as necessary, such as to ask our customers to indicate beneficiaries of a will, record shareholders of a company, or register authorized contacts to access their Keep It Simple account.  Keep It Simple uses this information for the sole purpose of administering its services for our customers, and does not use such information for any other reason.</p>



        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">In the regular course of our business, Keep It Simple may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and Keep It Simple employees or agents for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive email from Keep It Simple, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list by using the "Unsubscribe" link on any of the emails we send.</p>



        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us through our Help Desk.</p>

        <span _ngcontent-c1="" class="terms_heading">Use of Cookies and Beacons</span>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Keep It Simple, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or partners may also collect information via cookies and web beacons. We use cookies and web beacons to run certain features of our web site, to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about user traffic and behavior so that we can offer better experiences and tools to our customers. We may also contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. </p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Cookies are small files that enable us to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of Applications.  We do not capture Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such order forms, will be limited. You may, at your discretion, configure your software so that it does not accept cookies, though you may not be able to access certain portions or features of our web site.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Web beacons help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our site.  Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">You may choose not to provide Keep It Simple or its subsidiaries and/or affiliates with Personally Identifiable Information. If you make this decision, you may continue to use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, we cannot process orders without Personally Identifiable Information.</p>



        <span _ngcontent-c1="" class="terms_heading">How We Use the Information We Collect</span>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Your Personal Information (including information that is automatically collected and information from cookies and web beacons) may be used for the following purposes: (i) to deliver the services you request, (ii) to improve our web site, services, features and content, (iii) to personalize your experience on our web site, (iv) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements, (v) to provide you with further information and offers from us or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on services and products offered by us or third parties, (vii) to monitor and analyze use of our web site and our services, (viii) to administer our web site, (ix) to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and web site use behavior of our users, and (x) to verify that visitors of our web site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We reserve the right to compile and share aggregated information about our users, transactions completed using our service, sales, and traffic, though we will not share this information in a manner that permits the identification of a specific user.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting us. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by using the "Unsubscribe" link and following the unsubscribe instructions in any electronic communication.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site, to measure customer satisfaction.  If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes name, email address, and mailing address.  We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site, and/or to send participants an email newsletter.  We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

        <span _ngcontent-c1="" class="terms_heading">Protection and Security of Your Personal Information</span>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Keeping your Personal Information safe is of the utmost importance to us.  All personally identifiable information is maintained on secure servers, protected from unauthorized use, access or disclosure. Credit card and personal information are transmitted by secure servers (SSL). Unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to or from the Site, Applications, or through the use of our services, and you provide this information at your own risk. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, YOUR DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS BY USING THE SITE, APPLICATIONS, AND OUR SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ASSUME THESE RISKS.</p>

        <span _ngcontent-c1="" class="terms_heading">Disclosure to Third Parties</span>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We do not sell, transfer, or otherwise share your Personal Information, or any data that you store using our services, to third parties except as otherwise outlined herein. Additionally, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a corporate transaction such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets. In any such event, you will receive notice if your data is transferred and becomes subject to a substantially different privacy policy. We may also release your Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety. Non-personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Certain Personal Information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or state government, or with a court. For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name become public information when its articles of incorporation are filed. A Secretary of State may publish this information to its website or provide this information to third parties for a fee. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office publishes the names and addresses of trademark registrants. In some states, fictitious business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a newspaper. The Keep It Simple Privacy Policy does not cover these or similar third-party actions.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers received through email surveys.  We ask for your specific consent as part of the survey.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us.  We also display customer reviews.  If you provide a review that we display and wish to update or delete it, you can also contact us.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We may link to, include or offer third party products or services on or through our web site. If you choose to use any such third party services, we may facilitate sharing of your information and documents you choose to use with those services.  Your use of those services is not governed by our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.  We do not control the services of those third parties or how they use your information and documents. Be sure to review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third parties before using their services.  Likewise, our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Keep It Simple, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or Keep It Simple subsidiary, may use your Personal Information to process your payment through merchant account services, and to generate the products and services you order.  Your Contact Data may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate through Online Services, respond to inquiries made through Online Services, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information about Keep It Simple and its products and services.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third party offer or purchase a package that includes a third-party offer, we may provide your Personal Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We may also disclose your Personal Information: as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">We may share your Personal Information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer or email service provider), help us market our products and services, or for training purposes. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. This means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based upon your previous visits to our site.
