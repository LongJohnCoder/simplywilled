        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Reservation of Rights:&nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">This provision shall apply only to disputes brought by customers against Keep It Simple. Claims by Keep It Simple against customers, employees, agents, competitors, and any other third parties shall be excluded from this provision.&nbsp; Keep It Simple reserves all rights to bring a claim or lawsuit in any forum or venue of jurisdiction against a customer, employee, agent, competitor or third party for violations of its Terms of Services, Terms of Use, other supplemental terms and policies, or any alleged violation of its intellectual property rights.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Summary:&nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by contacting us at <a _ngcontent-c1="" href="mailto:info@simplywilled.com">info@simplywilled.com</a>. &nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-c1="">In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if Keep It Simple has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction.</strong>&nbsp;Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts.<strong _ngcontent-c1="">&nbsp; By using our Site and Services, you agree that any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis and waive the right to participate in a class action; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong><strong _ngcontent-c1="">&nbsp;No arbitration proceeding of any nature shall be certified as a class action or proceed as a class action, or on a basis involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other customers, or potential customer or Persons similarly situated.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">You may speak with independent legal counsel before using this Site or completing any purchase. &nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera"><strong _ngcontent-c1="">Arbitration Agreement:&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(a) Keep It Simple and you agree to arbitrate&nbsp;<strong _ngcontent-c1="">all disputes and claims</strong>&nbsp;between us before a single arbitrator. The types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted. It applies, without limitation, to:</p>

        <ul _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_unorder_list">
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;</li>
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "Keep It Simple," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, business partners, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us. &nbsp;Beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.&nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in the small claims court of the District of Columbia Superior Court. You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in the District of Columbia; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed passive that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Keep It Simple, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the District of Columbia. You expressly agree that your rights and obligations, these Terms, and any disputes shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, excluding its choice of law rules. You also acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to a jury trial, and to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Keep It Simple otherwise agree in writing, you agree not to consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.<strong _ngcontent-c1="">&nbsp; You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Keep It Simple are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong></p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">This arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.&nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") to the other party. &nbsp;A Notice to Keep It Simple should be addressed to: Notice of Dispute, General Counsel, Keep it Simplel LLC, 1725 DeSales Street NW, Suite 600, Washington, DC 20036 (the "Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Keep It Simple and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Keep It Simple may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Keep It Simple or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Keep It Simple is entitled.&nbsp;</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(c) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at&nbsp;<a _ngcontent-c1="" href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. &nbsp;The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.&nbsp; All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide.&nbsp; Unless Keep It Simple and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your contact address. &nbsp;If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator or by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If you choose to proceed either in person or by telephone, we may choose to respond only by telephone or submission. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a hearing. The parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of any dispute or claim to which Keep It Simple was a party. The payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(d) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Keep It Simple's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then Keep It Simple will:</p>

        <ul _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_unorder_list">
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">pay you either the amount of the award or $2,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and</li>
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the "attorney's payment").</li>
          <li _ngcontent-c1="">IN NO EVENT SHALL KEEP IT SIMPLE, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO KEEP IT SIMPLE HEREUNDER.</li>
        </ul>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">If Keep It Simple did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.&nbsp; In assessing whether an award that includes attorney’s fees or expenses is greater than the value of Keep It Simple’s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in his or her calculations only the value of any attorney’s fees or expenses you reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding before Keep It Simple’s settlement offer.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorney's fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND KEEP IT SIMPLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless both you and Keep It Simple agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other customers.&nbsp; Neither you nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other customers.&nbsp; If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. An award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.</p>

        <p _ngcontent-c1="" class="privacy_pera">(h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice address, website link or telephone number provided herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of which we had written notice on the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this arbitration provision, any such termination will not be effective until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.</p>
