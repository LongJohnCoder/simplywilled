        <h1 class="core_value_text">Our Story</h1>
        <p class="our_history_pera">
            In 2016, our founder, Peter Antonoplos, was featured in a magazine interview opposite the general counsel of a major online legal services company.  In the interview, Peter discussed the common pitfall experienced by many users of DIY online legal services that he had seen time and time again in his legal practice:  the customer signed documents they didn’t understand, the documents had unintended consequences, and now the customer needed a lawyer to untangle the mess they had made.  In that moment, Peter realized that customers needed a better solution – an online legal tool that was truly simple to use, and that created legal documents in plain language that are truly simple to understand.  From there, SimplyWilled.com was born.</p>
        <h1 class="core_value_text">Our Commitment</h1>
        <p class="our_history_pera">
            SimplyWilled.com is founded by lawyers who practice in the field, with decades of experience litigating, administering, and planning estates for thousands of clients in multiple jurisdictions in the United States.

SimplyWilled.com is designed to take the complexity, the “legalese,” and the mystery out of estate planning. 
        </p>
        <p class="our_history_pera">
            Our users understand every stage of our easy-to-use interview, and most importantly, every term in the documents they create and execute.

And using our simple do-it-yourself tool, you can take control of your legacy from the comfort of your home or office, or even while on the go.
