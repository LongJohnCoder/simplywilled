Your last will give you the power to decide how you would like your most precious assets to be distributed. In Alaska, if you own a business or hold other investments, your will can facilitate the smooth transition of those assets to the ones you love. A valid Alaska last will may also provide for friends, charitable and religious organizations, and academic institutions that would not otherwise inherit from the laws of intestacy. The important concept is the choice is yours. If you don\u2019t have a valid will, Alaska\u2019s probate court will apply local intestacy laws to determine who should receive your property. This can result in wasted time, money, and costly court fights.","meta_keywords":"Alaska last will, Last will and testament, Alaska personal representative, Alaska executor, Alaska guardian, Alaska
